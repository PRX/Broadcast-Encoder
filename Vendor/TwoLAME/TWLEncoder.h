/**
 
 TWLEncoder provides an interface for encoding PCM audio data to MPEG Audio
 Layer 2. It relies on the TwoLAME library, and allows for options that affect
 the audio encoding to be set in an abstract way.
 
 A TWLEncoder may be bound to a delegate object. The delegate is invoked for
 certain events during the lifetime of an encoder.
 
 TWLEncoder instances are threadsafe.
 
 A TWLEncoder creates TWLEncoderTask objects which represent the action
 of a file being encoded. TWLEncoderTask objects are always created in
 a suspended state and must be sent the -resume message before they will
 execute.

 A TWLEncoderTask will directly write the encoded MP2 audio data to a 
 temporary file. When completed, the delegate is sent
 encoder:task:didFinishEncodingToURL: and given an opportunity to move
 this file to a permanent location in its sandboxed container, or to
 otherwise read the file. If canceled, any encoded audio data for an
 TWLEncoderTask is lost.
